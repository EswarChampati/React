because browser already have the super powers of dom ie browsers have the js engine in it.
broswers dont aware of the react and even our project dont know about the react for that we want to get react

go to cdn react in google and copy that links and paste them inside our react project.now ur project has
that super power inside it.now what ever code i written in react that our broswer will understand 

cdn links
